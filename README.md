SteamUser allows you to communicate with the Steam servers in the same manner as a proper Steam client. It's designed to
be a self-contained module which provides all the functionality expected of a Steam user client.

Node.js v14.0.0 or later is required.

Some of the documentation for `SteamUser`, especially documentation for experimental features (but not exclusively),
is located in [the GitHub wiki](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/wiki).

# Patterns [^](#contents)

There are a number of coding patterns that are repeated throughout `SteamUser`. **Please read this section in its
entirety before starting work with `SteamUser`.**

### Callbacks and Promises

All methods listed in this document that accept a callback also return a `Promise`. You may use either callbacks or
promises.

Legacy callbacks return their data spanning across multiple arguments. All promises (which return any data at all)
return a single object containing one or more properties. The names of these properties for legacy callbacks are the
names of the callback arguments listed in this readme. Newer callbacks return a single object `response` argument, which
is identical to the promise output for that method.

Some methods indicate that their callback is required or optional. **You are never required to use callbacks over
promises**, but if a callback is listed as optional then an unhandled promise rejection will not raise a warning/error.
If a callback is listed as required and you neither supply a callback nor handle the promise rejection, then a
promise rejection will raise a warning, and eventually a crash in a future Node.js release.

# Enums [^](#contents)

There are a lot of enums used in Steam. They're all available directly from `SteamUser`. For example, access `EResult`
using `SteamUser.EResult`.

All enums can be viewed [on GitHub](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/tree/master/enums).

Additionally, for convenience, the name of an enum value is available from any enum at the key identified by the enum
value. For example, given an EResult of `88` you can translate it using `SteamUser.EResult[88]` which gives you
the string `TwoFactorCodeMismatch`.

# Static Methods [^](#contents)

Static methods, or functions attached directly to `SteamUser`, are called on the root module and not on instantiated handler instances.

### formatCurrency(amount, currency)
- `amount` - The amount of the currency
- `currency` - The currency code value in the [`ECurrencyCode`](#ecurrencycode) enum

Formats a currency value and returns a string. For example:

```js
console.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(12.34, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.USD)); // $12.34
console.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(12345, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.JPY)); // ¥ 12345
console.log(SteamUser.formatCurrency(123.45, SteamUser.ECurrencyCode.EUR)); // 123,45€
```

# Options [^](#contents)

There are a number of options which can control the behavior of the `SteamUser` object. They are:

### accountIdentifier

A string which identifies the account. This is not the same as your SteamID.
It's used as salt for internal methods, for example when generating the machineId.

Defaults to `null`, which means internal methods will be used to select a proper identifier.

### dataDirectory

Controls where the Steam server list and machine auth token files are written. If `null`, no data will be automatically
stored.

Defaults to a platform-specific user data directory.

- On [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com), this is `$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR/node-steamuser`
- On Windows, this is `%localappdata%\doctormckay\node-steamuser`
- On Mac, this is `~/Library/Application Support/node-steamuser`
- On Linux, this is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/node-steamuser`, or `~/.local/share/node-steamuser` if `$XDG_DATA_HOME` isn't defined or is empty

#### Custom Storage Engine

If you don't want to (or can't) save data to the disk, you can implement your own storage engine. To do this, simply add the following code:

```js
user.storage.on('save', function(filename, contents, callback) {
	// filename is the name of the file, as a string
	// contents is a Buffer containing the file's contents
	// callback is a function which you MUST call on completion or error, with a single error argument

	// For example:
	someStorageSystem.saveFile(filename, contents, function(err) {
		callback(err);
	});
});

user.storage.on('read', function(filename, callback) {
	// filename is the name of the file, as a string
	// callback is a function which you MUST call on completion or error, with an error argument and a Buffer argument

	// For example:
	someStorageSystem.readFile(filename, function(err, file) {
		if(err) {
			callback(err);
			return;
		}

		callback(null, file);
	});
});
```

In this manner, you can save data to a database, a cloud service, or anything else you choose.

### autoRelogin

A boolean which controls whether or not `SteamUser` will automatically reconnect to Steam if disconnected due to Steam going down.

Defaults to `true`.

### machineIdType

What kind of machine ID will SteamUser send to Steam when logging on? Should be a value from [`EMachineIDType`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/blob/master/resources/EMachineIDType.js).

Added in 1.7.0.

Defaults to `AccountNameGenerated`.

### machineIdFormat

If you're using `machineIdType` `AccountGenerated`, this is the format it uses. This is an array of three strings, each of which will be hashed with SHA1 before being sent to Steam. `{account_name}` will be replaced with the current account name.

Added in 1.13.0.

Defaults to `["SteamUser Hash BB3 {account_name}", "SteamUser Hash FF2 {account_name}", "SteamUser Hash 3B3 {account_name}"]`.

### enablePicsCache

If enabled, then `node-steam-user` will internally cache data in memory about all apps and packages that it knows about.
Currently, `node-steam-user` "knows about" an app/package if:

- Packages
    - You own it, or
    - You request info about it via `getProductInfo`
- Apps
    - It's in a known package, or
    - You request info about it via `getProductInfo`, or
    - A friend who is online plays the app, or
    - You request info about an online user who is playing it via `getPersonas`

This option is required in order to use several methods and events. This works when logging in anonymously.

Added in 3.3.0.

Defaults to `false`.

### picsCacheAll

If `picsCacheAll` is enabled, `enablePicsCache` is enabled, and `changelistUpdateInterval` is nonzero, then apps and
packages which get updated while your bot is running will also be added to the cache. Default behavior is to only cache
apps and packages that are "known" via the above criteria.

Added in 3.3.0.

Defaults to `false`.

### changelistUpdateInterval

If `enablePicsCache` is enabled, then `node-steam-user` will automatically request app/package changes (via
`getProductChanges`) for known apps and packages, and update the internal cache when they update. This is the frequency,
in milliseconds, for changelist update requests. Set to `0` to disable.

Added in 3.3.0.

Defaults to `60000`. Minimum value `1000`, although you're recommended to not go below 10 seconds or so.

### ownershipFilter

Specify a custom app/package ownership filter object or function to be applied to all calls to `getOwned*()` and `owns*()`
where a filter is not specified in the method invocation. If you specify a `filter` when you call `getOwned*()` or `owns*()`,
then that filter is applied and the global `ownershipFilter` is ignored.

Added in 4.22.0.

Defaults to a filter that excludes expired licenses only.

This filter can be either an object or a function:

#### Filter Object

A filter object should contain zero or more of these properties:

- `excludeFree` - Pass `true` to exclude free licenses (no cost/guest pass/free on demand/free commercial license)
- `excludeShared` - Pass `true` to exclude licenses acquired via [family sharing](https://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing)
- `excludeExpiring` - Pass `true` to exclude licenses that have an expiration date (e.g. free weekends) but are not yet expired

Any omitted properties are assumed to be `false`. If you don't specify an ownership filter, an empty object is assumed.

#### Filter Function

You can also provide your own custom filter function. This function will be called for each license owned by your account,
and should return `true` to include a license or `false` to exclude it. This function should have the same arguments
as the callback you'd pass to [Array.prototype.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter).

The `element` argument will be an object of type
[Proto_CMsgClientLicenseList_License](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/blob/9312326c34fed69a2ea6c4102ed25e3073f0516d/protobufs/generated/_types.js#L9755-L9775)
(same as the [`licenses`](#licenses) property).

Please note that when you specify a custom filter function, expired licenses (e.g. past free weekends) will be sent to
your filter function as candidates for inclusion, but these licenses are filtered out in all other cases. You can determine
if a license is expired by checking `if (license.flags & SteamUser.ELicenseFlags.Expired)`.

Example usage:

```js
user.setOption('ownershipFilter', (license) => {
	// only passes licenses that were acquired at least a year ago
	let time = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
	return time - license.time_created >= 60 * 60 * 24 * 365;
});
```

### additionalHeaders

Set this to an object where keys are header names and values are header values, and those headers will be included
with all HTTP requests `node-steam-user` makes to the Steam WebAPI.

Added in 3.29.0.

Defaults to `{}`.

### localAddress

Pass an IP here (as a string) to bind to that address, or `null` to let the OS decide.

Added in 4.0.0.

Defaults to `null`.

### localPort

Pass a port here to bind to that port, or `null` to let the OS decide.

Added in 4.0.0.

Defaults to `null`.

### httpProxy

Specify a URL here to use an HTTP proxy. For example, `http://user:pass@1.2.3.4:8081`

Added in 4.0.0.

### socksProxy

Specify a URL here to use a SOCKS proxy. SOCKS4, SOCKS4a, and SOCKS5 are supported.

Example: `socks5://x1234567:kNRLnUDG46@proxy-nl.privateinternetaccess.com:1080`

Added in 4.26.0.

### protocol

A value from [`EConnectionProtocol`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/blob/master/resources/EConnectionProtocol.js).

Added in 4.0.0.

Defaults to `Auto`.

### language

Set this to the full name of a language (e.g. "english" or "spanish") to localize specific things within steam-user.
Currently this is only used to localize `rich_presence_string` in [`user`](#user) event data and in `requestRichPresence`.

Added in 4.0.0.

Defaults to `english`.

### webCompatibilityMode

If you're having trouble connecting to Steam (e.g. through a firewall or a proxy), set this to `true`. When in web
compatibility mode, connections to Steam will always use WebSockets (the `protocol` option will be ignored, and you
will get a warning if you set it to `TCP`), and only Steam servers listening on port 443 will be considered.

Added in 4.6.0.

Defaults to `false`.

### saveAppTickets

If true, then calls to [`getAppOwnershipTicket`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/wiki/Steam-App-Auth#getappownershipticketappid-callback)
will save ownership tickets to disk and will return cached tickets unless they are expired.

Added in 3.5.0.

Defaults to `true`.

### renewRefreshTokens

If true, then `SteamUser` will attempt to renew your refresh token every time you call [`logOn()`](#logondetails) by
passing a refresh token. If renewal succeeds, the [`refreshToken`](#refreshtoken) event will be emitted, and the refresh
token you used to log on will become invalid.

Added in 5.0.0.

Defaults to `false`.

# Methods [^](#contents)

### Constructor(options)
- `options` - An optional object containing zero or more [options](#options-) to set for this `SteamUser`.

Constructs a new `SteamUser`.

Prior to v4.0.0, it was possible to pass a SteamClient instance as the first argument to this constructor. This functionality was removed in v4.0.0. [See the full list of v4 changes.](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

### setOption(option, value)
- `option` - The name of the option to set
- `value` - The value to set for this option

Changes the value of an [option](#options-).

### setOptions(options)
- `options` - An object containing zero or more [options](#options-).

### logOn([details])
- `details` - An object containing details for this logon
	- `anonymous` - Pass `true` if you want to log into an anonymous account, omit or pass `false` if not
	- `refreshToken` - A refresh token, [see below](#using-refresh-tokens)
	- `accountName` - If logging into a user account, the account's name
	- `password` - If logging into an account without a refresh token or web logon token, the account's password
    - `machineAuthToken` - If logging into an account that has email Steam Guard using the account name and password,
       pass a valid machine auth token to avoid needing to provide an `authCode`. This is only necessary in advanced cases,
       as steam-user [will take care of this for you by default](#machine-auth-tokens)
	- `webLogonToken` - If logging into an account with a [client logon token obtained from the web](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamcommunity/wiki/SteamCommunity#getclientlogontokencallback), this is the token
	- `steamID` - If logging into an account with a client logon token obtained from the web, this is your account's SteamID, as a string or a `SteamID` object
	- `authCode` - If you have a Steam Guard email code, you can provide it here. You might not need to, see the [`steamGuard`](#steamguard) event. (Added in 1.9.0)
	- `twoFactorCode` - If you have a Steam Guard mobile two-factor authentication code, you can provide it here. You might not need to, see the [`steamGuard`](#steamguard) event. (Added in 1.9.0)
	- `logonID` - A 32-bit integer to identify this login. The official Steam client derives this from your machine's private IP (it's the `obfuscated_private_ip` field in `CMsgClientLogOn`). If you try to logon twice to the same account from the same public IP with the same `logonID`, the first session will be kicked with reason `SteamUser.EResult.LogonSessionReplaced`. Defaults to `0` if not specified.
		- As of v4.13.0, this can also be an IPv4 address as a string, in dotted-decimal notation (e.g. `"192.168.1.5"`)
	- `machineName` - A string containing the name of this machine that you want to report to Steam. This will be displayed on steamcommunity.com when you view your games list (when logged in).
	- `clientOS` - A [number](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/blob/master/enums/EOSType.js) to identify your client OS. Auto-detected if you don't provide one.

**v3.11.0 or later is required to use `machineName`.**  
**v4.3.0 or later is required to use `webLogonToken`.**  
**v4.25.0 or later is required to use `refreshToken`.**  
**v4.29.0 or later is required to use `machineAuthToken`.**

Logs onto Steam. Omit the `details` object if you wish to login to an anonymous user account.

There are five ways to log onto Steam:

- Anonymously
	- Pass `anonymous: true` to log onto an anonymous user account
    - These properties are optional:
        - `machineName`
        - `clientOS`
        - *All other properties **must not** be provided*
    - In versions of steam-user prior to 4.27.0, logging on anonymously was accomplished by simply omitting `refreshToken`
      and `accountName` (or omitting the `details` object entirely). If neither property was set then steam-user would
      default to logging on anonymously. This is still current behavior, but logging on in this manner is now deprecated.
      If you now call `logOn()` without providing a `refreshToken` or `accountName` and without specifying `anonymous: true`,
      then steam-user will raise a warning and then log on anonymously.
- Individually using a refresh token **(recommended)**
	- These properties are required:
        - `refreshToken`
    - These properties are optional:
        - `steamID` - If provided, steam-user will check to make sure that the provided `refreshToken` matches this SteamID. If SteamIDs don't match, the app will crash.
        - `logonID` - Defaults to 0 if not specified.
        - `machineName` - Defaults to empty string if not specified.
        - `clientOS` - Defaults to an auto-detected value if not specified.
    - These properties must not be provided:
        - `accountName`
        - `password`
        - `machineAuthToken`
        - `webLogonToken`
        - `authCode`
        - `twoFactorCode`
- Individually using account name and password
	- These properties are required:
		- `accountName`
		- `password`
	- These properties are optional:
        - `machineAuthToken` - Specify if you are logged into an account with email Steam Guard and you have a valid machine token
		- `authCode` - Specify if you are using an email Steam Guard code.
		- `twoFactorCode` - Specify if you are using a TOTP two-factor code (required if your account has 2FA enabled).
		- `logonID` - Defaults to 0 if not specified.
		- `machineName` - Defaults to empty string if not specified.
		- `clientOS` - Defaults to an auto-detected value if not specified.
	- These properties must not be provided:
		- `webLogonToken`
		- `steamID`
- Individually using account name and [client logon token obtained from the web](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamcommunity/wiki/SteamCommunity#getclientlogontokencallback) (deprecated)
	- **NOTE:** If you log on this way, [`webSession`](#websession) will **NOT** be emitted automatically, and you will need to use [`webLogOn()`](#weblogon) to get a web session.
	- These properties are required:
		- `accountName`
		- `webLogonToken`
		- `steamID`
	- These properties must not be provided:
		- `password`
        - `machineAuthToken`
		- `authCode`
		- `twoFactorCode`
		- `logonID`
		- `machineName`
		- `clientOS`

#### Using Refresh Tokens

The Steam client uses refresh tokens when logging on. You can obtain a refresh token using the
[steam-session module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-session), or you can log on to steam-user using your account name and password as normal. When
logging on using your account name and password, steam-user will internally fetch a refresh token, emit the
[`refreshToken`](#refreshtoken) event, and then use that token to log on to Steam.

As of 2022-09-03, refresh tokens are JWTs that are valid for ~200 days. You can keep using the same refresh token to log
on until it expires. You can find out when a token expires by [decoding it](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=jwt) and checking
the `exp` property, which is a Unix timestamp indicating when the token expires.

If you attempt to log on using a refresh token that isn't valid for use with client logins, the app will crash with a
relevant error message.

#### Machine Auth Tokens

When using email Steam Guard, *machine auth tokens* are used to remember a device, in order to bypass the requirement to
provide a code every time you login. By default, steam-user will automatically save your machine auth tokens in your
[data directory](#datadirectory), but you can also manage them yourself by listening for the [`machineAuthToken`](#machineauthtoken)
event and providing the token as a `machineAuthToken` property when you log on.

### logOff()

Logs you off of Steam and closes the connection.

### relog()

**v3.18.0 or later is required to use this method**

Logs you off of Steam and then immediately back on. This can only be used if one of the following criteria are met:

- You're logged into an anonymous account
- You're logged into an individual account and you logged in using an account name and password
- You're logged into an individual account and you used a `refreshToken` to log on

Attempts to call this method under any other circumstance will result in an `Error` being thrown and nothing else will happen.

When used, `disconnected` and then `loggedOn` will be emitted in succession. This is essentially the same as using
`logOff()` and then calling `logOn()` immediately in the `disconnected` event callback.

### webLogOn()

`SteamUser` will automatically log onto steamcommunity.com when a successful connection to Steam is established (as an
individual user), but you can call `webLogOn()` to create a new session if your old one expires or becomes invalid.

Listen for the [`webSession`](#websession) event to get your cookies.

you'll receive the activation code by email. You'll need to provide the activation code to `finalizeTwoFactor`.

**You should save the entire `response` object somewhere secure.** You can use `JSON.stringify` on it safely.

Properties of note in the `response` object:
- `status` - A value from `EResult`. If this is not `OK` (1), then the request failed.
- `shared_secret` - This is your secret that's used for two-factor authentication.

**v3.3.0 or later is required to use this method**  
**v4.7.0 or later is required to use `excludeSharedLicenses`**  
**v4.22.0 or later is required to use `filter`**

Returns an array of AppIDs which your account owns. This cannot be safely called until `ownershipCached` is emitted.

`enablePicsCache` must be `true` to use this method. Otherwise, an `Error` will be thrown.

If `filter` is a boolean, it is interpreted as `excludeShared` for backward compatibility. For example,
`getOwnedApps(true)` is the same as `getOwnedApps({excludeShared: true})`.
This usage is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The output of this function will contain all AppIDs that are present in at least one license that was not filtered out.
For example, if you previously activated a free on demand package for Spacewar but later activated a retail CD key for
the same, it will be included if you pass `{excludeFree: true}` as your filter since you own it both via a free package
and via a paid package.

### ownsApp(appid[, filter])

`ownershipCached` is emitted.

`enablePicsCache` must be `true` to use this method. Otherwise, an `Error` will be thrown.

If `filter` is a boolean, it is interpreted as `excludeShared` for backward compatibility. For example,
`ownsApp(730, true)` is the same as `ownsApp(730, {excludeShared: true})`.
This usage is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The output of this function will be true if the provided AppID is present in at least one license that was not filtered out.

### getOwnedDepots([filter])

`getOwnedDepots(true)` is the same as `getOwnedDepots({excludeShared: true})`.
This usage is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The output of this function will contain all depot IDs that are present in at least one license that was not filtered out.

### ownsDepot(depotid[, filter])

**v4.22.0 or later is required to use `filter`**

Returns `true` if your account owns the specified depot, or `false` if not. This cannot be safely called until
`ownershipCached` is emitted.

`enablePicsCache` must be `true` to use this method. Otherwise, an `Error` will be thrown.

If `filter` is a boolean, it is interpreted as `excludeShared` for backward compatibility. For example,
`ownsDepot(731, true)` is the same as `ownsDepot(731, {excludeShared: true})`.
This usage is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The output of this function will be true if the provided depot ID is present in at least one license that was not filtered out.

### getOwnedPackages([filter])
- `filter` - A filter object or function (see [`ownershipFilter`](#ownershipfilter))

**v3.3.0 or later is required to use this method**  
**v4.7.0 or later is required to use `excludeSharedLicenses`**  
**v4.22.0 or later is required to use `filter`**

Returns an array of package IDs which your account owns.

If `filter` is a boolean, it is interpreted as `excludeShared` for backward compatibility. For example,
`getOwnedPackages(true)` is the same as `getOwnedPackages({excludeShared: true})`.
This usage is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

The output of this function will contain all package IDs for which you have at least one license that was not filtered out.

The point at which this method can be called depends on the following:

- If you are logged on anonymously, this can be called immediately following the `loggedOn` event
- If you are using no filters, or if you're using the `excludeShared` filter and no other filters, this can be called immediately following the `licenses` event
- If you are using a custom filter function or if you're using the `excludeFree` and/or `excludeExpiring` filters, this can be called immediately following the `ownershipCached` event (which means `enablePicsCache` must be true)

### ownsPackage(packageid[, filter])
- `packageid` - A numeric package ID
- `filter` - A filter object or function (see [`ownershipFilter`](#ownershipfilter))

**v3.3.0 or later is required to use this method**

**v4.22.0 or later is required to use `filter`**

Returns `true` if your account owns the specified package ID, or `false` if not.

The output of this function will be true if your account has at least one license for the provided package ID that wasn't
filtered out.

The same timing requirements apply to this method as apply to [`getOwnedPackages`](#getownedpackagesfilter).

If `filter` is a boolean, it is interpreted as `excludeShared` for backward compatibility. For example,
`ownsPackage(16018, true)` is the same as `ownsPackage(16018, {excludeShared: true})`.
This usage is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

- `richPresence` - An object containing your rich presence data. All values should be strings.

**v4.4.0 or later is required to use this method**

Uploads rich presence data to Steam. In order to display text in the Steam friends list, you need a key named `steam_display`,
which **must** be a rich presence localization key (you can see RP keys for apps [on SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/440/localization/)).

`%placeholders%` in the rich presence localization value will be replaced with the value of the corresponding key that
you upload. For example, to get a TF2 RP string of "Special Event - Hello, World!", then you should upload:

```json
{
	"steam_display": "#TF_RichPresence_Display",
	"state": "PlayingMatchGroup",
	"matchgrouploc": "SpecialEvent",
	"currentmap": "Hello, World!"
}
```

This will subsequently be parsed like this:

1. `#TF_RichPresence_Display` = `{#TF_RichPresence_State_%state%}`
2. `{#TF_RichPresence_State_PlayingMatchGroup}` = `{#TF_RichPresence_MatchGroup_%matchgrouploc%} - %currentmap%`

**v4.0.0 or later is required to use this method**

Requests localized rich presence strings for a particular app in the given language. This will allow you to decode the

**v4.18.0 or later is required to use this method**

Requests rich presence key/value data and localized strings as displayed in Steam for a list of given users, for a given
app. You do not need to be friends with the requested users. Response object looks like this:

```json
{
    "users": {
        "76561198006409530": {
            "richPresence": {
                "status": "Playing CS:GO",
                "version": "13765",
                "time": "15.851017",
                "game:state": "lobby",
                "steam_display": "#display_Menu",
                "connect": "+gcconnectG02C0193A"
            },
            "localizedString": "Playing CS:GO"
        }
    }

```

If the Steam display string cannot be localized, then `localizedString` will be null. This is the case when there exists
no translation for the language you selected.

In theory, the nickname list in `myNicknames` will always be up-to-date since v3.23.0, but you may wish to use this if
you want to be doubly sure.

[Read SteamChatRoomClient docs here.](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/wiki/SteamChatRoomClient)

### redeemKey(key[, callback])
- `key` - Steam formatted game key
- `callback` - Optional. Called when request completes
	- `err` - An `Error` object on failure, or `null` on success
	- `purchaseResultDetails` - A `SteamUser.EPurchaseResult` value
	- `packageList` - An object whose keys are packageIDs and values are package names

**v3.2.0 or later is required to use this method**

Redeems a game code (CD key) on your account. If this request fails, the `Error` object will have `purchaseResultDetails`
and `packageList` properties, and you should access this data via the `Error` object and not via the callback arguments.

### requestFreeLicense(appIDs[, callback])
- `appIDs` - An array of AppIDs for which you want licenses
- `callback` - Optional. Called when request completes
    - `err` - An `Error` object on failure, or `null` on success
    - `grantedPackageIds` - An array of package IDs that were granted to your account as a result of this request
    - `grantedAppIds` - An array of AppIDs that were granted to your account as a result of this request

**v3.18.0 or later is required to use this method**

Requests a free-on-demand license to be granted to your account.

Older free-to-play games are in the "Steam" package ([package ID 0](https://steamdb.info/sub/0/)). This package is
automatically granted to all accounts (but not anonymous ones). Games in this package do not need a license to be
explicitly requested.

All newer free-to-play games have "free-on-demand packages". These are packages that are not automatically granted to
all accounts, but will be granted upon request ("on demand"). This is so that the Steam client can show free-to-play
games you have previously added to your library when not installed. In order to "play" any free-to-play app that isn't
in sub 0, you need to request a license for it using this method.

If successful, calling this method will result in the [`licenses`](#licenses-1) event being emitted containing your new
license(s).

**Please note:** This method is rate-limited to approximately 50 apps per hour.

**Please note:** This method only works with free-on-demand licenses. Promotional free licenses
(i.e. "free to keep for a limited time") cannot be requested using this method. You can request such licenses using
the steamstore module's [addFreeLicense](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamstore#addfreelicensesubid-callback) method.

### getLegacyGameKey(appid, callback)
- `appid` - The Steam AppID of the app for which you want a legacy key
- `callback` - Called when the request completes
    - `err` - If there was an error, this is an `Error` object. Otherwise, it's `null`.
    - `response` - The response object
        - `key` - Your key, as a string

**v4.24.0 or later is required to use this method**

Requests your legacy CD key for a game in your library. This will only succeed if the game in question uses legacy CD
keys (usually you'll get a Steam popup when you launch this game presenting you with your key which you can copy and
paste into the game when prompted).

### markNotificationsRead(notificationIds)
- `notificationIds` - Array of notification IDs from [`notificationsReceived`](#notificationsreceived) (numbers or strings) to mark as read

**v5.2.0 or later is required to use this method**

Marks a list of notifications as read. There is no response or feedback to this method.

### markAllNotificationsRead()

**v5.2.0 or later is required to use this method**

Marks all notifications as read. There is no response or feedback to this method.

### createEncryptedAppTicket(appid[, userData], callback)
- `appid` - The Steam AppID of the app for which you want a ticket
- `userData` - If the app expects some "user data" (arbitrary data which will be encrypted into the ticket), provide it here. Otherwise, omit this argument or pass an empty Buffer.
- `callback` - Called when the request completes
    - `err` - If there was an error, this is an `Error` object. Otherwise, it's `null`.
    - `encryptedAppTicket` - If successful, this is your encrypted appticket as a Buffer. You should provide the entire contents of the Buffer to the recipient.

**v3.14.0 or later is required to use this method**

Requests an "encrypted app ticket" from Steam servers for a particular game. This can be used to prove your ownership of
an app and also your account identity to some publisher server, provided they're expecting an encrypted app ticket.
To use encrypted app tickets, publishers must set up an encryption key in the Steamworks backend. Therefore, this will
not work if encrypted tickets haven't been set up for the AppID you request a ticket for. You cannot decrypt an
encrypted app ticket, nor can you view anything it contains. It is for all intents and purposes an opaque blob of binary
data which only the developer/publisher of the game can do anything with.

### sendToGC(appid, msgType, protoBufHeader, payload[, callback])

**v4.1.0 or later is required to use this method**

[Please see documentation for GC interaction on the GitHub wiki.](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/wiki/Game-Coordinator)

# Events [^](#contents)

## ID Events

Events marked as **ID events** are special. They all have a `SteamID` object as their first parameter. In addition to the
event itself firing, a second event comprised of `eventName + "#" + steamID.getSteamID64()` is fired.

For example:

```js
// This will fire when we receive a chat message from ANY friend
user.on('friendMessage', function(steamID, message) {
	console.log("Friend message from " + steamID.getSteam3RenderedID() + ": " + message);
});

// This will fire when we receive a chat message from [U:1:46143802] / 76561198006409530 ONLY
user.on('friendMessage#76561198006409530', function(steamID, message) {
	console.log("Friend message from " + steamID.getSteam3RenderedID() + ": " + message);
});
```

### loggedOn
- `details` - An object containing various details about your account (see [`CMsgClientLogonResponse`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/SteamKit_1.6.3/Resources/Protobufs/steamclient/steammessages_clientserver.proto#L93-L116))
- `parental` - An object containing your parental controls settings

**v3.5.0 or later is required to use `parental`.**

Emitted when you're successfully logged into Steam.

### steamGuard
- `domain` - If an email code is needed, the domain name of the address where the email was sent. `null` if an app code is needed.
- `callback` - Should be called when the code is available.
	- `code` - The Steam Guard auth code
- `lastCodeWrong` - `true` if you're using 2FA and the last code you provided was wrong, `false` otherwise

This event will be emitted when Steam requests a Steam Guard code from us.
You should collect the code from the user somehow and then call the `callback` with the code as the sole argument.

If no listener is bound to this event, then `steam-user` will prompt the user for a code via stdin.

**If you are using 2FA, you need to check the `lastCodeWrong` argument.** If it's true, then the last code you provided
was incorrect (likely already used). In this case, you should wait 30 seconds to allow the TOTP algorithm to generate a
new code. Failure to do so will result in a login loop, causing your IP address to be temporarily banned.

Example:

```js
user.on('steamGuard', function(domain, callback) {
	console.log("Steam Guard code needed from email ending in " + domain);
	var code = getCodeSomehow();
	callback(code);
});
```

### error
- `err` - An `Error` object

Emitted when an error occurs during logon. Also emitted if we're disconnected and `autoRelogin` is either disabled, or it's a fatal disconnect.

If this event isn't handled, the program will crash.

The `SteamUser` object's `steamID` property will still be defined when this is emitted. The `Error` object will have an `eresult` parameter which is a value from the [`EResult`](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/blob/SteamKit_1.6.3/Resources/SteamLanguage/eresult.steamd) enum.

### disconnected
- `eresult` - A value from the `SteamUser.EResult` enum
- `msg` - A string describing the reason for the disconnect, if available (might be undefined)

Emitted when we're disconnected from Steam for a non-fatal reason and `autoRelogin` is enabled. `SteamUser` will
continually retry connection and will either emit `loggedOn` when logged back on, or `error` if a fatal logon error is
experienced.

Also emitted in response to a logOff() call.

The `SteamUser` object's `steamID` property will still be defined when this is emitted.

The `eresult` value might be 0 (Invalid), which indicates that the disconnection was due to the connection being closed
directly, without Steam sending a LoggedOff message.

### machineAuthToken
- `machineAuthToken` - A string containing your new machine auth token

**v4.29.0 or later is required to use this event**

Emitted when a new machine auth token is issued. This is only relevant for accounts using email Steam Guard. Even if you
are using email Steam Guard, you likely don't need to worry about this event as steam-user will [automatically manage
your machine auth tokens for you](#machine-auth-tokens).

This may be emitted before [`loggedOn`](#loggedon) fires.

### refreshToken
- `refreshToken` - A string containing your new refresh token

**v5.0.0 or later is required to use this event**

Emitted when a new refresh token is issued. This will always be emitted when logging on using an account name and password,
and when logging on using an existing refresh token, this may be emitted if a new refresh token is issued because your
provided token is nearly expired (only if [`renewRefreshTokens`](#renewrefreshtokens) is set to true).

This may be emitted before [`loggedOn`](#loggedon) fires.

### webSession
- `sessionID` - The value of the `sessionid` cookie
- `cookies` - An array of cookies, as `name=value` strings

Emitted when a steamcommunity.com web session is successfully negotiated.
This will automatically be emitted on logon (**unless** you used a `webLogonToken` to log on) and in response to
[`webLogOn`](#weblogon) calls.

Some libraries require you to provide your `sessionID`, others don't. If the library you're using doesn't need you to
provide a `sessionID`, then you can safely ignore it.

[Read more about how cookies work and interact with other modules.](https://dev.doctormckay.com/topic/365-cookies/#user-cookieusage)

### newItems
- `count` - How many new items you have (can be 0)

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of new items. You can reset the count to 0 by loading your inventory page (https://steamcommunity.com/my/inventory) while logged in.

- `myItems` - How many of the total comments are on your content (workshop items, screenshots, your profile, etc.)
- `discussions` - How many of the total comments are posts in subscribed discussion threads

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of new comments.

### tradeOffers
- `count` - How many active received trade offers you have (can be 0)

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of new trade offers. This gets emitted shortly after logon iff it's nonzero, and
every time it changes thereafter (i.e. both when you receive a trade offer and when an active trade offer you received
gets accepted/canceled/declined).

### communityMessages
- `count` - How many unread community (moderator) messages you have (can be 0)

**v3.26.0 or later is required to use this event**

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of new community (moderator) messages. This gets emitted shortly after logon iff
it's nonzero, and every time it changes thereafter (i.e. both when you receive a community message and when a community
message gets read).

### offlineMessages
- `count` - How many unread offline chat messages you have
- `friends` - An array of SteamID strings for the users who have sent you unread offline chat messages

Emitted when Steam sends a notification of unread offline chat messages. This will always be emitted after logon, even if you have no messages.

### notificationsReceived
- `payload` - An object containing these properties:
	- `notifications` - An array of objects containing these properties:
        - `id` - Notification ID, as a string
        - `type` - Notification type, from [ESteamNotificationType](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user/blob/master/enums/ESteamNotificationType.js) enum
        - `body` - Notification "body data", which varies depending on the notification type
        - `read` - Boolean indicating whether the notification has been marked read
        - `timestamp` - `Date` object indicating when the notification was created
        - `hidden` - Boolean indicating whether the notification should be hidden from the client (has been deleted/cleared)
        - `expiry` - `Date` object indicating when the notification expires
        - `viewed` - `Date` object indicating when the notification was viewed, or `null` if not yet viewed

**v5.2.0 or later is required to use this event**

Emitted when the Steam backend notifies us of new or changed notifications. The behavior is not 100% intuitive, but here
is what has been observed:

- If a new notification is received, this will be emitted with **only that new notification**. Any other pending notification
    will not be included in the `notifications` array
- If you open the notification dropdown, unviewed notifications will be marked as viewed, and **only those changed notifications**
    will be included in the `notifications` array
- If a notification is marked as read, this doesn't appear to be emitted at all
- If a notification is hidden (removed), **only that hidden notification** will be included in the `notifications` array
    with `hidden: true` 
- This is never emitted in response to [`markNotificationsRead()`](#marknotificationsreadnotificationids)
    or [`markAllNotificationsRead()`](#markallnotificationsread)

### vanityURL
- `url` - Your new vanity URL

**v3.7.0 or later is required to use this event**

Emitted when your vanity URL changes. `url` is your new vanity URL. This event is emitted before the [`vanityURL`](#vanityurl)

- `facebookName` - If your account is linked with Facebook, this is your (real) name on Facebook

**v3.4.0 or later is required to use this event**

Emitted on logon and when account info changes. This event is emitted before the [`accountInfo`](#accountinfo) property is updated, so you can compare to see what changed.

### emailInfo
- `address` - Your account's email address
- `validated` - A boolean value for whether or not your email address is validated

Emitted on logon and when email info changes. The [`emailInfo`](#emailinfo) property will be updated after this event is emitted.

Emitted on logon and when limitations change. The [`limitations`](#limitations) property will be updated after this event is emitted.

### vacBans
- `numBans` - How many bans your account has
- `appids` - The AppIDs from which you're banned. Since each ban affects a range of AppIDs, some of the AppIDs in this array may not exist.

Emitted on logon and probably when you get banned/unbanned. The [`vac`](#vac) property will be updated after this event is emitted.

### wallet
- `hasWallet` - `true` if your account has a Steam Wallet, `false` if not
- `currency` - The currency ID of your account's wallet (the enum of currencies is available as `SteamUser.ECurrencyCode`)

Emitted on logon and when licenses change. The [`licenses`](#licenses) property will be updated after this event is
emitted.

This isn't emitted for anonymous accounts. However, all anonymous user accounts have a license for package 17906
automatically.

### gifts
- `gifts` - An array of gift objects

Emitted on logon and when you receive/accept/decline a gift or guest pass. The [`gifts`](#gifts) property will be
updated after this event is emitted.

Guest Passes (do they even still exist?) are gifts (actually, gifts are Guest Passes with a very long expiration date).
Consequently, both come through this event.

Each object in the array is an oustanding gift or guest pass that was sent to you that you haven't accepted/declined yet.
Only **outstanding** gifts show up here. Gifts that you stored in your inventory don't show up here.

The structure of the objects in the array is defined in the documentation for the [`gifts`](#gifts) property.

### ownershipCached

### appUpdate
- `appid` - The AppID of the app which just changed
- `data` - An object identical to that received from `getProductInfo`

**v3.3.0 or later is required to use this event**

Emitted when an app that was already in our cache updates. The `picsCache` property is updated after this is emitted, so
you can get the previous app data via `picsCache.apps[appid]`.

### packageUpdate
- `packageid` - The PackageID of the package which just changed
- `data` - An object identical to that received from `getProductInfo`

**v3.3.0 or later is required to use this event**

**v3.4.0 or later is required to use this event**

Emitted on logon, and when new marketing messages are published. Marketing messages are the popups that appear after
you exit a game if you have "Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases"
enabled in the Steam client.

### tradeRequest
- `steamID` - The SteamID of the user who sent the request, as a `SteamID` object
